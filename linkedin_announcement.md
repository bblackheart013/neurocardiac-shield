I am pleased to share the completion of my Advanced Project at New York University: **NeuroCardiac Shield** - a multi-modal physiological monitoring platform for real-time cardiovascular-neurological risk assessment.

This project represents months of intensive work in medical device software development, combining embedded systems engineering, cloud architecture, machine learning, and clinical informatics.

**Technical Highlights:**

- 8-channel EEG acquisition following the international 10-20 electrode placement system
- 3-lead ECG monitoring with PQRST morphology analysis
- Real-time signal processing using Butterworth filters and Pan-Tompkins algorithms
- Ensemble machine learning combining XGBoost (interpretable features) and Bidirectional LSTM (temporal patterns) for 3-class risk prediction
- FastAPI cloud backend with asynchronous data ingestion
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time visualization
- End-to-end latency under one second with inference times of approximately 80 milliseconds

**Compliance and Standards:**

The system architecture was designed with IEC 62304 Class B medical device software lifecycle standards in mind, incorporating HIPAA-aware data handling and GDPR-ready principles.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**

- Full-stack medical device software development
- Biomedical signal processing and feature engineering
- Production machine learning deployment
- Healthcare regulatory compliance frameworks
- Professional software engineering practices

I want to acknowledge the contributions of **Vaibhav Devram Chandgir** as a collaborator on this project.

The complete codebase, documentation, and technical specifications are available on GitHub:

This experience has deepened my understanding of the intersection between healthcare technology and software engineering, and I am excited to continue exploring opportunities in medical device development and health informatics.

I welcome connections with professionals working in biomedical engineering, medical devices, health technology, and related fields.
