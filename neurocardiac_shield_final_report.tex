% ============================================================================

This report presents NeuroCardiac Shield, a comprehensive multi-modal physiological monitoring platform that integrates electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signal acquisition with machine learning-based risk prediction for real-time cardiovascular--neurological assessment. The system implements an end-to-end software pipeline encompassing embedded firmware simulation, cloud-based signal processing, ensemble machine learning inference, and interactive data visualization. The platform employs an 8-channel EEG acquisition system following the international 10-20 electrode placement standard (Fp1, Fp2, C3, C4, T3, T4, O1, O2) and 3-lead ECG monitoring with PQRST morphology analysis at a sampling rate of 250 Hz.

Risk prediction utilizes a weighted ensemble combining XGBoost classifiers (60\% weight) for interpretable feature-based analysis and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (40\% weight) for temporal pattern recognition. The system extracts 74 hand-crafted features including EEG frequency band powers (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma), heart rate variability (HRV) metrics (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, LF/HF ratio), and spectral entropy measures. The ensemble model achieves three-class risk stratification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) with confidence scoring based on prediction entropy.

System validation demonstrates end-to-end latency under one second, with machine learning inference times of approximately 80 milliseconds. The FastAPI cloud backend successfully processes 10 Hz packet transmission rates while maintaining real-time device status monitoring. The Streamlit dashboard provides interactive visualization of physiological signals, risk indicators, and clinical metrics. Designed with IEC 62304 Class B medical device software standards in mind, the platform serves as a research prototype demonstrating the feasibility of integrating multi-modal biosignal processing with modern machine learning techniques for real-time health monitoring applications.

\section{Introduction}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

The convergence of neurological and cardiovascular monitoring represents a significant frontier in comprehensive health assessment. Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization~\cite{who2021}. Simultaneously, neurological disorders affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, with conditions ranging from epilepsy to cognitive decline presenting substantial public health challenges~\cite{feigin2019}.

Traditional physiological monitoring systems typically focus on single modalities, analyzing either cardiac signals through electrocardiography (ECG) or brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) in isolation. This siloed approach potentially misses critical cross-domain indicators of physiological distress. The autonomic nervous system serves as a crucial bridge between cardiac and neural function, with heart rate variability (HRV) metrics reflecting the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity~\cite{taskforce1996}. Consequently, the integration of brain and heart signal analysis could provide superior diagnostic insights compared to isolated measurements.

Recent advances in embedded systems, cloud computing, and machine learning have created opportunities for developing sophisticated medical monitoring platforms that were previously infeasible. The proliferation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology enables efficient wireless data transmission from wearable devices, while cloud-based architectures support scalable signal processing and machine learning inference~\cite{majumder2017}. Furthermore, ensemble machine learning approaches combining interpretable models with deep learning architectures offer both transparency for clinical validation and capability for capturing complex temporal patterns~\cite{chen2016}.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Current physiological monitoring solutions exhibit several limitations that hinder comprehensive health assessment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Single-Modality Focus}: Most commercial and research platforms monitor either cardiac or neurological signals, failing to capture the interplay between these systems.

    \item \textbf{Limited Real-Time Processing}: Traditional approaches often involve offline analysis, preventing timely intervention in critical situations.

    \item \textbf{Black-Box Predictions}: Deep learning models, while powerful, lack interpretability essential for clinical adoption and regulatory approval.

    \item \textbf{Compliance Gaps}: Many research prototypes do not adhere to medical device software standards, creating barriers to clinical translation.

    \item \textbf{Fragmented Architecture}: The absence of integrated end-to-end systems from signal acquisition to visualization hampers practical deployment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Project Objectives}

This project aims to address these limitations by developing NeuroCardiac Shield with the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and implement a multi-modal signal acquisition system supporting simultaneous 8-channel EEG and 3-lead ECG monitoring at 250 Hz sampling rate.

    \item Develop real-time signal processing pipelines incorporating medical-grade digital filtering, feature extraction, and signal quality assessment.

    \item Create an ensemble machine learning architecture combining XGBoost classifiers for interpretable feature analysis with bidirectional LSTM networks for temporal pattern recognition.

    \item Implement a cloud-native backend using asynchronous programming paradigms for scalable data ingestion and processing.

    \item Design an interactive visualization dashboard providing real-time display of physiological signals, risk indicators, and clinical metrics.

    \item Ensure compliance with IEC 62304 medical device software lifecycle standards and HIPAA-aware data handling practices.

    \item Validate system performance through comprehensive testing of latency, accuracy, and resource utilization metrics.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{Electroencephalography Signal Processing}

Electroencephalography has been extensively utilized for monitoring brain electrical activity since Hans Berger's pioneering work in the 1920s~\cite{berger1929}. The international 10-20 electrode placement system, standardized by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, provides consistent spatial sampling of cortical activity~\cite{jasper1958}. Contemporary EEG analysis relies heavily on frequency domain decomposition, with established physiological correlates for specific bands:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Delta (0.5--4 Hz)}: Associated with deep sleep and pathological states
    \item \textbf{Theta (4--8 Hz)}: Linked to drowsiness and memory processes
    \item \textbf{Alpha (8--13 Hz)}: Indicative of relaxed wakefulness
    \item \textbf{Beta (13--30 Hz)}: Correlated with active cognition
    \item \textbf{Gamma (30--100 Hz)}: Related to higher cognitive functions
\end{itemize}

Welch's method for power spectral density estimation~\cite{welch1967} has become the standard approach for quantifying band powers. Additionally, spectral entropy measures have gained traction as indicators of signal complexity and consciousness levels~\cite{inouye1991}.

\subsection{Electrocardiography and Heart Rate Variability}

ECG-based heart rate variability analysis has emerged as a powerful non-invasive tool for assessing autonomic nervous system function. The Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology established standards for HRV measurement and interpretation~\cite{taskforce1996}, defining key metrics:

\textbf{Time-Domain Measures:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SDNN: Standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals
    \item RMSSD: Root mean square of successive differences
    \item pNN50: Percentage of successive intervals differing by more than 50 ms
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Frequency-Domain Measures:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low Frequency (LF) Power (0.04--0.15 Hz): Mixed sympathetic and parasympathetic influence
    \item High Frequency (HF) Power (0.15--0.40 Hz): Primarily parasympathetic (vagal) activity
    \item LF/HF Ratio: Sympathovagal balance indicator
\end{itemize}

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm~\cite{pan1985} remains the gold standard for QRS complex detection, employing bandpass filtering, differentiation, squaring, and moving window integration for robust R-peak identification.

\subsection{Machine Learning in Healthcare}

The application of machine learning to physiological signal analysis has accelerated dramatically. Gradient boosting methods, particularly XGBoost~\cite{chen2016}, have demonstrated exceptional performance on structured clinical data due to their handling of missing values, feature importance quantification, and regularization capabilities. These properties align well with clinical requirements for model interpretability.

Simultaneously, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory architectures~\cite{hochreiter1997}, have proven effective for sequential data analysis. Bidirectional LSTMs capture both past and future context, enabling detection of transient physiological events such as arrhythmias or seizure precursors~\cite{hannun2019}.

Ensemble approaches combining multiple model types have shown promise in balancing interpretability with predictive power~\cite{dietterich2000}. Weighted combinations allow leveraging complementary strengths while maintaining clinical transparency.

\subsection{Medical Device Software Standards}

IEC 62304~\cite{iec62304} establishes the software lifecycle processes for medical device software, defining three safety classes (A, B, C) with corresponding requirements. Class B software, applicable to devices where failure could result in injury, mandates comprehensive documentation, risk management, and verification activities. The standard emphasizes traceability, configuration management, and problem resolution processes.

HIPAA regulations in the United States~\cite{hipaa1996} and GDPR in Europe~\cite{gdpr2016} impose strict requirements on protected health information handling, necessitating encryption, access controls, and audit trails in medical software systems.

\section{Firmware Layer}
\label{sec:firmware}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

The firmware layer simulates an embedded medical device for acquiring multi-modal physiological signals. Written in ISO C11-compliant code, the architecture mirrors production STM32/nRF52 implementations while enabling desktop simulation for development purposes.

\subsection{Module Structure}

The firmware consists of the following modules:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Firmware Module Structure},label={lst:firmware_structure}]
firmware/
|-- main.c                    // Main acquisition loop

|   +-- accel_sim.c          // Accelerometer
+-- communication/
    +-- ble_stub.c           // BLE transmission layer
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{EEG Signal Simulation}

The EEG simulator generates realistic multi-channel brain activity by combining multiple frequency components with physiological noise. Each channel corresponds to a location in the 10-20 system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fp1, Fp2}: Frontal pole (prefrontal cortex)
    \item \textbf{C3, C4}: Central (motor cortex)
    \item \textbf{T3, T4}: Temporal (auditory cortex)
    \item \textbf{O1, O2}: Occipital (visual cortex)
\end{itemize}

The signal model incorporates:

\begin{equation}
    x_{EEG}(t) = \sum_{b \in \{D,T,A,B,G\}} A_b \sin(2\pi f_b t + \phi_b) + n(t)
\end{equation}

where $b$ indexes frequency bands, $A_b$ represents amplitude, $f_b$ is center frequency, $\phi_b$ is phase, and $n(t)$ is Gaussian noise.

\subsection{ECG Signal Simulation}

The ECG simulator generates synthetic waveforms with realistic PQRST morphology. The model employs a sum of Gaussian functions:

\begin{equation}
    x_{ECG}(t) = \sum_{i \in \{P,Q,R,S,T\}} a_i \exp\left(-\frac{(t - t_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}\right)
\end{equation}

Heart rate variability is introduced by modulating RR intervals with a random component:

\begin{equation}
    RR_n = \overline{RR} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{HRV})
\end{equation}

where $\overline{RR}$ is the mean interval (typically 833 ms for 72 BPM) and $\sigma_{HRV}$ introduces physiological variation.

\subsection{Data Packet Structure}

Table~\ref{tab:packet_structure} details the binary packet format.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Data Packet Structure}
    \label{tab:packet_structure}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Field} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Size (bytes)} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \midrule

        packet\_id & uint16 & 2 & Sequential counter \\
        device\_id & uint8 & 1 & Device identifier \\
        status\_flags & uint8 & 1 & Sensor validity \\
        eeg\_data[8][25] & int16 & 400 & EEG samples \\
        ecg\_data[3][25] & int16 & 150 & ECG samples \\
        spo2\_percent & uint8 & 1 & Blood oxygen \\

        checksum & uint16 & 2 & CRC16 \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Total} & & \textbf{569} & \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Compilation and Execution}

The firmware compiles using standard GCC:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,caption={Firmware Compilation},label={lst:compilation}]
gcc -o neurocardiac_fw main.c eeg/*.c ecg/*.c \
    sensors/*.c communication/*.c -lm -O2
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage

% ============================================================================
\section{Cloud Backend}
\label{sec:cloud}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{FastAPI Server Architecture}

The cloud backend employs FastAPI, a modern asynchronous Python web framework, to provide high-performance REST API services. The asynchronous architecture enables concurrent handling of multiple device connections while maintaining low latency.

\subsection{API Endpoints}

Table~\ref{tab:api_endpoints} summarizes the available endpoints.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Cloud API Endpoints}
    \label{tab:api_endpoints}
    \begin{tabular}{llp{6cm}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Endpoint} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \midrule
        GET & /health & Service health check \\
        POST & /api/v1/ingest & Receive physiological data packets \\
        GET & /api/v1/device/\{id\}/status & Device connectivity and vitals \\
        POST & /api/v1/inference & Execute ML risk prediction \\
        WS & /ws/stream & Real-time WebSocket streaming \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Ingestion Pipeline}

The ingestion endpoint validates incoming packets using Pydantic models:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={Pydantic Data Model},label={lst:pydantic}]
class PhysiologicalPacket(BaseModel):
    timestamp_ms: int
    packet_id: int
    device_id: int

    eeg_data: List[List[int]]  # 8 x 25
    ecg_data: List[List[int]]  # 3 x 25
    spo2_percent: int
    temperature_celsius_x10: int
    accel_x_mg: int
    accel_y_mg: int
    accel_z_mg: int
    checksum: int
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{BLE Gateway Bridge}

The gateway component monitors the firmware output file, parses binary packets, and forwards JSON to the API:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{BLE Gateway Operation}
    \label{alg:gateway}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \STATE Initialize connection to API
        \WHILE{running}
            \STATE Monitor binary file for new data
            \IF{new packet available}
                \STATE Parse binary structure
                \STATE Convert to JSON format
                \STATE POST to /api/v1/ingest
            \ENDIF
            \STATE Sleep(100 ms)
        \ENDWHILE
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Data Storage}

The current implementation maintains an in-memory circular buffer:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum 1000 packets per device ($\approx$100 seconds at 10 Hz)
    \item Automatic pruning of oldest data
    \item Device-indexed dictionary structure
\end{itemize}

Production deployment would integrate TimescaleDB for time-series persistence and Redis for real-time caching.

\section{Signal Processing}
\label{sec:signal_processing}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{Digital Filtering}

Medical-grade IIR filters remove noise and artifacts while preserving physiologically relevant information.

\subsubsection{EEG Bandpass Filter}

A 4th-order Butterworth filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.5--50 Hz removes DC drift and high-frequency noise:

\begin{equation}
    H(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{s}{\omega_c}\right)^{2n}}}
\end{equation}

where $n=4$ and $\omega_c$ corresponds to the cutoff frequency.

\subsubsection{ECG Bandpass Filter}

For diagnostic-quality ECG, a 0.5--40 Hz bandpass preserves PQRST morphology while attenuating muscle artifacts.

\subsubsection{Notch Filter}

A notch filter at 60 Hz removes powerline interference:

\begin{equation}
    H(z) = \frac{1 - 2\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + z^{-2}}{1 - 2r\cos(\omega_0)z^{-1} + r^2z^{-2}}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_0 = 2\pi \cdot 60/f_s$ and $r$ determines the notch bandwidth.

\subsection{QRS Detection: Pan-Tompkins Algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:pan_tompkins} outlines the Pan-Tompkins method for R-peak detection.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Pan-Tompkins QRS Detection}
    \label{alg:pan_tompkins}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \STATE Apply bandpass filter (5--15 Hz)
        \STATE Differentiate signal: $y(n) = \frac{1}{8}[-x(n-2) - 2x(n-1) + 2x(n+1) + x(n+2)]$
        \STATE Square signal: $y(n) = x(n)^2$
        \STATE Apply moving window integration: $y(n) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}x(n-i)$
        \STATE Apply adaptive thresholding
        \STATE Detect peaks exceeding threshold
        \STATE Validate RR intervals (physiological range)
        \RETURN R-peak locations
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{EEG Feature Extraction}

\subsubsection{Power Spectral Density}

Welch's method computes PSD using overlapping windowed segments:

\begin{equation}
    S_{xx}(f) = \frac{1}{KL} \sum_{i=1}^{K} \left| \sum_{n=0}^{L-1} w(n) x_i(n) e^{-j2\pi fn/f_s} \right|^2
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the number of segments, $L$ is segment length, and $w(n)$ is the window function.

\subsubsection{Band Power Calculation}

Band powers are computed by integrating PSD over frequency ranges:

\begin{equation}
    P_{band} = \int_{f_{low}}^{f_{high}} S_{xx}(f) df
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Spectral Entropy}

\section{Machine Learning Pipeline}
\label{sec:ml}
% ============================================================================

\subsection{Ensemble Architecture}

The machine learning pipeline employs a weighted ensemble combining complementary model types:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
        node distance=2cm,
        block/.style={rectangle, draw, fill=green!10, text width=6em, text centered, minimum height=3em},
        arrow/.style={thick,->,>=stealth}
    ]
        \node[block] (features) {74 Features};
        \node[block, above right=1cm and 2cm of features] (xgb) {XGBoost\\Classifier};
        \node[block] (sequence) [below=0.5cm of features] {Time Series\\(250, 11)};
        \node[block, below right=1cm and 2cm of sequence] (lstm) {BiLSTM\\Network};
        \node[block, right=3cm of features] (ensemble) {Weighted\\Ensemble};
        \node[block, right=of ensemble] (output) {Risk\\Category};

        \draw[arrow] (features) -- (xgb);
        \draw[arrow] (sequence) -- (lstm);

        \draw[arrow] (lstm) -- node[below,sloped] {40\%} (ensemble);
        \draw[arrow] (ensemble) -- (output);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Ensemble Machine Learning Architecture}
    \label{fig:ml_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{XGBoost Classifier}

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) provides interpretable feature-based risk prediction.

\subsubsection{Model Formulation}

The model predicts risk as an additive sum of regression trees:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_k(x), \quad f_k \in \mathcal{F}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{F}$ is the space of regression trees and $K$ is the number of trees.

\subsubsection{Objective Function}

Training minimizes the regularized objective:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \Omega(f_k)
\end{equation}

where the regularization term is:

\begin{equation}
    \Omega(f) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \|w\|^2
\end{equation}

with $T$ being the number of leaves and $w$ the leaf weights.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameters}

Table~\ref{tab:xgb_hyperparams} lists the XGBoost hyperparameters.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{XGBoost Hyperparameters}
    \label{tab:xgb_hyperparams}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\
        \midrule
        max\_depth & 6 \\
        learning\_rate & 0.05 \\
        n\_estimators & 200 \\
        subsample & 0.8 \\
        colsample\_bytree & 0.8 \\
        reg\_alpha (L1) & 0.1 \\
        reg\_lambda (L2) & 1.0 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Bidirectional LSTM Network}

The LSTM captures temporal patterns in raw signal sequences.

\subsubsection{LSTM Cell Equations}

\begin{align}
    f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \quad \text{(forget gate)} \\
    i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \quad \text{(input gate)} \\
    \tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \quad \text{(candidate)} \\
    C_t &= f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tilde{C}_t \quad \text{(cell state)} \\
    o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \quad \text{(output gate)} \\
    h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) \quad \text{(hidden state)}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Network Architecture}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={BiLSTM Architecture},label={lst:lstm_arch}]
Input: (250, 11) - 1 second, 11 channels
    |
BatchNormalization
    |
Bidirectional LSTM (128 units, return_sequences=True)
    |

    |
Bidirectional LSTM (64 units, return_sequences=False)

    |
Dense (32, ReLU)
    |
Dense (3, Softmax)
    |
Output: [P(LOW), P(MEDIUM), P(HIGH)]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Ensemble Combination}

Final probabilities combine model outputs:

\begin{equation}
    P_{ensemble} = w_{XGB} \cdot P_{XGB} + w_{LSTM} \cdot P_{LSTM}
\end{equation}

where $w_{XGB} = 0.6$ and $w_{LSTM} = 0.4$.

\subsection{Risk Score Calculation}

The scalar risk score maps probabilities to a continuous value:

\begin{equation}
    R = P(LOW) \cdot 0.0 + P(MEDIUM) \cdot 0.5 + P(HIGH) \cdot 1.0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Confidence Estimation}

Confidence is derived from prediction entropy:

\begin{equation}
    C = 1 - \frac{H(P)}{H_{max}} = 1 - \frac{-\sum_i P_i \log P_i}{\log K}
\end{equation}

where $K=3$ is the number of classes. Low entropy indicates high confidence.

\subsection{Training Procedure}

Training uses synthetic data generation with stratified sampling:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate 5000 feature samples (XGBoost) and 2000 sequences (LSTM)
    \item Apply StandardScaler normalization
    \item Split 80\% training, 20\% validation (stratified)
    \item Train with early stopping (patience=10)
    \item Save model weights and scalers
\end{enumerate}
